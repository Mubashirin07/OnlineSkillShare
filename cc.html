                        <div class="d1">
                        <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer  faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale</p>
                        <p>You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change. <br><br></p><br>
                        </div>
                        <br>

                        <h1>Benefits</h1>
                       <p> Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources.<br> Here are seven common reasons organizations are turning to cloud computing services:</p>
                       <ul>
                        <li><h3>Cost</h3><p>Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site <br> datacenters— the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. <br>It adds up fast.</p></li>
                        <li><h3>Global scale</h3><p>The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the<br> right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed,<br> and from the right geographic location.</p></li>
                        <li><h3>Performance</h3><p>The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to<br> the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter,<br> including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.</p></li>
                        <li><h3>SEcurity</h3><p>Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall,<br> helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.</p></li>
                        <li><h3>Speed</h3><p>Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off<br> capacity planning.</p></li>
                        <li><h3>Reliability</h3><p>Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.</p></li>
                        <li><h3>Productivity</h3><p>On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time <br>-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.</p></li>
                       </ul>

                        <h1 id="types">Types of cloud computing</h1>
                        <p>Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types,<br> and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.</p>
                        <p>First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment, or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be<br> implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud. </p>

                        <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
                        <p>Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources, like<br> servers and storage, over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware,<br> software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and<br> manage your account using a web browser</p>
                        <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
                        <p>A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can<br> be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host<br> their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network. </p>
                        <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                        <p>Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared<br> between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business<br> greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance</p>

                        <h1>Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless, and SaaS</h1>
                        <p>Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS),<br> serverless, and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing "stack" because they build on<br> top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they’re different makes it easier to accomplish your business goals.</p>
                        <h3>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h3>
                        <p>The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs),<br> storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
                        <a href="#">Learn more About Iaas</a>
                        <h3>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>
                        <p>Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering,<br> and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps,<br> without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and <br>databases needed for development.</p>
                        <a href="#">Learn more about paas</a>
                        <h3>Serverless computing</h3>
                        <p>Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the<br> servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management<br> for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific <br>function or trigger occurs.</p>
                        <h3>Software as a service (SaaS)</h3>
                        <p>Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription<br> basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any<br> maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet,<br> usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.</p>
